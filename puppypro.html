        <p class="about-p">PuppyPro is a school project were I had to create a product that is paired with an <br>application. It works like a smart watch for humans however it is a dog collar which is <br>able to track your dogs steps, heartrate, sleep recod, calories burned, body temperature <br>and blood oxegen leven of your pet. </p>
        <p class="about-p">The dog collar is also a tracker, which keep track of where your pet is located at all <br> times just in case it gets lost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project1">
        <div>
            <img class="showcase" src="img/PuppyPro2.png" alt="">
            <p>The first step of the project was the case study where I had to understand how a tracker <br>works and how it gathers data, and compared a few smart dog collar apps and how <br> they work with their products, providing screenshots of their applications.</p>
            <p>After that, I wrote down what features do I want my application to have including how <br> will my prototype look like and what features do i want my product to look like.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img class="showcase" src="img/PuppyPro3.png" alt="">
        <p class="about-p">Then, it was time to start designing the prototype. I first started to design the low fidalety <br>wireframe to get a general idea of how I wanted my app to look like without making any <br>final decisions, but my idea of the app was quitle clear of how I wanted it to look like.</p>

        <div>
            <img class="showcase" src="img/PuppyPro4.png" alt="">
            <p>After the low fidalety, I created the final prototype along with the colours and fonts that I <br>wanted to use.</p>
